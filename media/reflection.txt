Java Reflection is a process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time.
The java.lang.Class class provides many methods that can be used to get metadata, examine and change the run time behavior of a class.
The java.lang and java.lang.reflect packages provide classes for java reflection.
Reflection API allows programmatic access to information about the fields, methods and 
constructors of loaded classes. It allows use of reflected fields, methods, and constructors 
to operate on their underlying counterparts, within security restrictions.
